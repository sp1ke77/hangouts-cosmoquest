A simple plugin that let's you embed a live Google Hangout on Air in a page or 
widget and announce the next show.

== Description ==

This plugin allows for embedding of a live Hangout on Air through Google and YouTube 
onto your Wordpress pages, posts, or widgets. When a show is not live, 
you can have it set to announce the next show, list your YouTube channel, 
and display an existing playlist.

Once the plugin is activated, a Hangouts item is added to your backend menu where you
can set your channel Settings, Add/Edit recurring show descriptions, and add an upcoming
show description or embed code for a live event. Embed the plugin output on a post or page
with the code [hangouts] and use the Widget options in your Appearance menu to add to your sidebar.
